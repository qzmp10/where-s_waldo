## Goals
The goals of this Where's Waldo project was to practice my newly acquired knowledge on Firebase, which proves backend functionalities as a service, to keep practicing my React code, and to practice using the styled-components React package.

## Challenges
Figuring out how to set up Firebase, how to use the functions associated with Firebase Cloudstore turned out to be a slight challenge. I also some difficulties with certains asynchronous functions not being called fast enough when my App component rendered which lead to a few bugs that I had to fix.

## What I could've done better
1. Testing. I forgot to use Jest for TTD during this project which is definitely a habit I should not pick up.
2. Organizing my project before starting it. My projects tend to become pretty disorganized as they go because of a lack of a 'plan. A whiteboard would probably help.
